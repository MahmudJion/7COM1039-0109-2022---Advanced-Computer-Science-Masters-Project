Assignment Tasks:

You should have done about 600 hours of effort by the time you submit your project report.  This assignment is worth 95% of the overall assessment for the module; the 300 hours of effort quoted relates primarily to the collation, writing and editing of the report and supporting documents, and the preparation and time were given to a demonstration and face to face discussion of your work with your assessors.

You should be aware from the outset that the report and your explanation of your work is the primary evidence used in the assessment, and it is the assessment of your abilities to conduct and deliver a project that is key.  Any software product or model or artefact that you may have produced during your project is not the main focus of the assessment.  In an extreme case, a student that submits a well-crafted piece of work, but fails to submit a report into how it was produced, will fail.  The project module is about assessing your abilities as a student in your discipline area.

As a guide, taken together, the report should be about 10,000 words in length.  The bibliography and appendices are not included in the word length.

You need to include your student ID number, name and your supervisor’s name on the first page of your report.

IMPORTANT: Please TYPE the following Declaration to your final report:

You could change the format/layout to suit your report but please place it before the Contents page.

Demonstration

You must give a demonstration of your work to your supervisor and second marker and answer questions from them about your work.  This demonstration is part of the formal assessment process and counts 20% of your FPR mark.  It is your responsibility to agree on a time and date for this with your supervisor (and the 2nd marker), and to turn up on time (and be prepared) for your demonstration. It should normally take place AFTER your FPR submission, though some may be prepared to do this before the submission deadline.

Please check the MSc Project Handbook for guidance on how to structure your final project report and how to prepare for your demonstration.
