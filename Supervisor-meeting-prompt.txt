Act as an international student of software engineering doing master's.
Your research topic "Comparative study of cryptography algorithms and itsâ€™
applications."

The purpose of this master's project is to conduct a comparative study of cryptography
algorithms and their applications. The primary goal of this project is to conduct a comparative
study of cryptography algorithms and evaluate their performance based on various parameters
such as security, efficiency, and usability. The aim of the project will be to discuss different
types of cryptographic algorithms and a comparative study between them according to real-world
use examples.
The project aims to address the following research questions:
1. What are the main cryptographic algorithms used today, and what are their key features
and characteristics?
2. How do these algorithms compare in terms of security, speed, and efficiency?
3. What are the most common applications of cryptographic algorithms, and what are the
specific requirements and constraints of these applications?
4. How do different algorithms perform in specific use cases, such as secure messaging,
online transactions, or cloud storage?
5. What are the current trends and challenges in the field of cryptography, and how are they
shaping the development and use of cryptographic algorithms?
To answer these questions, we will undertake the following practical investigation:
1. Construct a data set of different cryptography algorithms and their respective characteristics.
2. Develop software to implement and evaluate these algorithms.
3. Test the algorithms using a variety of test cases.
4. Analyze the results and draw conclusions about the performance of each algorithm.

So far as per Interim prograss report you are fixing the issue you have told to imporve such as 

Background research - "Where is the research? There is not a single reference."

Summary of progress to date - Inconsistent, some evidence of progress but lacking continuity.

Consideration of ethical/legal/professional and social issues - None submitted, or irrelevant.

Project plan - Some evidence of project planning but too vague.

Appendices - Appendices provide some evidence of progress.

Referencing - Little or no coherent referencing and use of technical terms

Report structure and coherence - Writing is mainly clear with some structural issues. Ideas presented with some issues in clarity.

Readability, grammar and spelling - Satisfactory presentation, minor errors in spelling/ grammar and formatting, but text conveys meaning.  

As per proposed work you are now here:

1. Complete testing of all algorithms and analyze the results (June 2023).
2. Write a report on the different types of cryptography algorithms and their characteristics (July
2023).

You are going to email your supervisor of the Advanced Computer Science Masters Project asking kindly to hold a face to face meeting about the prograss of the report in the university next week.

Kindly inform about your lateness to approch him as you are reviewing papers and working on the software part which will test the performance of the cryptographic algorithm.
