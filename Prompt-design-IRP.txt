Act as an academic researcher, here is the master's project topic "Comparative study of cryptography algorithms and itsâ€™ applications."  now write a interim progress report based on this format

3.2.1 Section 1: Introduction and overview
It is suggested that this section should be about 2-3 pages long in total, and you may add any
appropriate section or sub-section headings you wish to this list. You may reuse parts of your
Detailed Project Proposal (DPP) if appropriate [and in turn you may re-use parts of the Interim
Progress Report (IPR) in your final report]. Describe the research question your project sets
out to address as well as your proposed practical investigation. Describe any technical work
that you are undertaking as part of that investigation, such as the construction of data-sets or
software/hardware apparatus. Say what tools and techniques you are using for your
investigation, experimentation, and evaluation of your work. You should list the specific
deliverables you intend to produce during your project: design, documents, programs,
questionnaires, databases, test plans, experimental designs, results, etc.

3.2.2 Section 2: Progress to date
It is suggested that you write about 2-3 pages and add an appropriate section heading and any
necessary sub-headings. Describe the progress you have made so far i.e. what you have done.
Be specific. Problems encountered or anticipated and steps taken/to be taken to solve them.
Explain the supporting evidence you can provide for the work you have done, the documents
that demonstrate your achievements, and include these documents as appendices.

3.2.3 Section 3: Planned work
This section is expected to be about half to one page in length. Again, add an appropriate
section heading and any necessary sub-headings. List the major tasks that need to be completed
for the project to be a success, from start to finish (including any you have already completed)
with target completion dates. Explain what each task means and what deliverables it will
produce. Say how you will judge the quality of your project work and how you intend to
evaluate the process through which you have gone. Don't forget to include time for writing up
the final report and preparing for the demonstration/presentation after submission.

3.2.4 Bibliography
List any sources that you cite in your report. You should also list any sources that you have
used, even if not cited directly. Use the Harvard system for your in-text citations, and for your
references, producing one list, ordered by author surname (whether the material is drawn from
books, journals, web pages, forums or blogs, or is a piece of software).

3.2.5 Appendices
Include supporting evidence as appendices to your report. These should be numbered
(Appendix 1, Appendix 2 etc.) and each should start on a new page and be given a title. Your
tutor is not required to read the appendices but may refer to them for evidence to back up your
claims.
Typically, appendices will include evidence of design, investigative or practical work (e.g.
formal specifications, code, questionnaires, and so on). At this stage, it will mostly be workin-progress, and it is fine for this to be handwritten. You may scan documents and include them
with your submission if you wish; but you may not wish not to spend too much time on tasks
like scanning handwriting notes. Instead, you could take the materials to your next project
meeting so that your supervisor is aware of the progress you have made.

remember final report date is august  28 2023

Give me planned work date as project start from February 2023
