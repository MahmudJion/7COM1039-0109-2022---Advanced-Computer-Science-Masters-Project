Welcome to the module website for MSc Masters Project modules
The MSc Project modules is a 60-credit module, and it requires around of 600 hours of student effort. To get your work started, please plan your study around the teaching schedule (below) and MSc Project handbook, as it contains the learning outcomes, reading list and other key information about this module. It will not take long, and it will put you in good stead for the rest of the module.

It is necessary for the award of a Masterâ€™s level qualification to demonstrate your ability to bring together a variety of skills, experience and knowledge derived from different sources. The main purpose of the Master's project is to allow students to extend the principles and concepts they have learnt during study of advanced modules, and apply that knowledge in the context of a substantial piece of independent work.

What kind of project are we looking for? We are looking for a practical investigative project. You should be trying to answer some research questions.

It has to be practical, but we do not simply want a development project. It may be that much of the work is development, but the overall aim has to be to try to answer some questions.

It has to be investigative, you will probably learn and apply new skills, and you will certainly gain new knowledge, but it is not just about going to the LRC and reading lots of books. The knowledge you gain from your reading has to be applied to your practical work.
